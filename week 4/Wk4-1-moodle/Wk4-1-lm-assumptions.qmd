# Introduction to linear models

## Introduction

In the previous practical, we learned about using linear models to understand how `y` varies with a continuous `x` variable and a discrete `x` variable ...but how do we know our models are any good? Can we evaluate the validity of our linear models? 

In this practical, we will 

- build on what we learned last week, fitting linear models.
- explore approaches to assess how well our model fits the data, and ways to improve our model fits using transformation. 
- practice interpreting the outputs of models. 

Throughout we will work with various real-world datasets. By the end of today, you’ll have a solid foundation for applying these techniques to models you will be fitting in your own work.

## Key learning objectives

Our learning objectives today are:

- **run** a **linear regression** in R using `lm()`
- **interpret** the output of a **linear regression** 
- **run diagnostic checks** on your  model output using `check_model()` to assess whether it meets the assumptions of a linear model.

Let’s dive in! 🚀

## Setting up

**Materials:**

Everything you need for this prac is on Moodle

1. Download this week's materials zip file from Moodle, from the course page
2. Unzip the file by: 
  - MacOS: Double clicking the zipfile 
  - Windows: Right click on the zip file and click "Extract All" 
3. Move the extracted folder into the folder where you store materials for `BEES2041/` 
4. **Click on the Rstudio project file, eg. `Wk4-1-lm-assumptions.Rproj`** to open the RStudio project and you're in!!!

We will be working with various datasets collected. These are in the folder `data/`.

You will work in the relevant Quarto document for this prac. Within each Quarto doc there are several challenges for you to complete on your own devices in order to **answer the questions on Moodle**.

**Setting up: Packages:**

We will also be working with packages from the `tidyverse` and `easystats`, building on skills from previous pracs. You should have these already installed on your machines. The packages listed below are part of the `tidyverse` and `easystats` suite of packages.

In case you don't have them installed, here is code for you to do so:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Uncomment and run only the lines below only if you have not previously installed these.
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("easystats")
```

# Worked example 

## Loading packages

> **Note** that when running R in the browser we need to install the packages each time we start a new session or after you've checked your answers. We're only going to install the parts of `tidyverse` and `easystats` we need for this prac.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("performance")
install.packages("modelbased")
install.packages("see")
install.packages("emmeans")
```

> Remember to load the packages into R to use em!

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(performance)
library(modelbased)
```


## Worked example - Isaac with leaves across climates

![Remember Dr. Isaac Towers?! Image credit: Data Dan](images/isaac-plant-ecosystems.png){width=60%} <br>
We will be working with an example from Dr. Isaac Towers - a postdoc in the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences. Specifically, Isaac wants to know: How does a leaf's mass per area change with rainfall? His research is published in New Phytologist, you can have a read of his original study [here](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.19478). We will be working with the data Isaac compiled for us.  Recall, last week we ran a linear model using `log10_leaf_mass_per_area`, `log10_rainfall`, let's try run the same linear model again but with the raw, untransformed data.

## Read in data from a URL link

```{r}
# The link the contains our data
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicercode/BEES2041/refs/heads/main/week%203/Wk3-1-Linear-models/data/towers-2024.csv"

# Read in the data, drop columns where their names start with `log10`
data_towers <- read_csv(url) |>
  select(-starts_with("log10"))

data_towers
```

## Fit model

```{r}
towers_og_fit <- lm(leaf_mass_per_area ~ rainfall, data = data_towers)

summary(towers_og_fit)
```

## Check model assumptions

Recall from lectures this week that the assumptions of a linear model are:

1. **Linear** relationship between `x` and `y` 
2. **Residuals** are **normally** distributed
3. **Constant variance** of residuals (homogeneity of variance)
4. No major **outliers** / influential observations
5. **Independence** of points (sampling design)
6. Our **samples represent the population** of interest? (sampling design)

The last two assumptions have to do with the sampling design. You can only check the validity of these by carefully considering how the data was collected. Let's assume that Isaac has done a good job in collecting his data and that the last two assumptions are met.

We can check the remaining assumptions (1-4) using the outputs of `check_model()`.

> Note, you may need to click on "Zoom" to give the plots some room to breathe

```{r}
check_model(towers_og_fit)
```

In [this week's lectures](https://youtu.be/zzFyjTnAa8Y?si=LpkRecpF0LSVu91N), Data Dan goes through how to use the four main plots necessary for checking the assumptions of a linear model: 

1. **Linearity**
    - Check the relationship between fitted values and residuals
        - Should see no structure or patterns/curvature

2. **Normality of Residual**
    - Check the Quantile-Quantile plot
        - Sample points should fall along the line

3. **Homogeneity of Variance**
    - Check the relationship between fitted values and square root of standardised residuals
        - Line should be flat and horizontal
        - No clear pattern in points e.g. fanning out or grouping

4. **Influential Observations**
    - Check the leverage of each point
      - Points should fall within dashed lines

**How to report on your model checks**

Generally speaking, model checks are pretty standard and not very exciting. Typically

> Usually we don't include these in a publication or final report. You could include them in Supplementary information. We just need to say and explain what checks were done and how you amended your data if necessary to improve fit

## Make some adjustments to improve model fit

There are two ways we can improve the model fit for a linear model: 

- apply a transformation on the raw data
  - log, typically, log 10 `log10(var)` 
  - square root `sqrt(var)`
- if any, remove outliers 

Here we will focus on applying a `log10` transformation to the two relevant variables `leaf_mass_per_area` and `rainfall`. We will be creating a new variable using `mutate()` and will be assigning these new changes to `data_towers` into a new data object called `data_towers_transformed`.

```{r}
data_towers_transformed <- # Assign changes into a new dataset
  data_towers |> # start with data_towers
  mutate(
    # Create a new log10 transformed leaf mass per area
    log10_leaf_mass_per_area = log10(leaf_mass_per_area),
    # Create a new log10 transformed rainfall
    log10_rainfall = log10(rainfall)
  )

data_towers_transformed
```

## Fit model again

Let's try fit our model again using our transformed variables.

```{r}
towers_transformed_fit <- lm(log10_leaf_mass_per_area ~ log10_rainfall, data = data_towers_transformed)
```

## Check model assumptions again

Use `check_model()` on our new model fit using transformed data. How does it look?! 

```{r}
check_model(towers_transformed_fit)
```

By now it should be clear which is the better model fit.

## Let's compare the two models fitted to data

We will plot the data and the fitted models for both the original and transformed data. One of these models will be a better fit than the other. Hopefully you see why we transformed the data!

**Plot of original data**

```{r}
# Estimate means and confidence intervals
means_towers <- estimate_means(towers_og_fit, by = "rainfall")

# make the plot
ggplot(data_towers, aes(x = rainfall, y = leaf_mass_per_area)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, col = "red", alpha = 0.2, stroke = 0) +
  geom_ribbon(data = means_towers, aes(ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high, y = Mean), fill = "grey") +
  geom_line(data = means_towers, aes(y = Mean), col = "#EB8240", linewidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    title = "Response of woody-plants to rainfall",
    x = "Rainfall",
    y = "Leaf Mass per Area"
  )
```

Here we can see the issues identified by the model checks in the plot:

- **Linearity**: The line goes outside the data, and even predicts a negative value at high rainfall. 
- **Homogeneity of variance**: The residuals do not have constant variance.  Data are much more spread towards the left of the plot than the right.
- **Normality of residuals**: The residuals are not normally distributed. They are skewed to have much larger departures above compared to below the line.
- **Influential observations**: There are some points with really high y values that are likely having a disproportionate effect on the line


## Plot of transformed data

Here's a plot of the fitted model using the transformed data. Wow, what a difference! You can see the difference in the fit. The improved fit of the model and meeting of assumptions mean we can more confidently make interpretations on the relationship between rainfall and leaf mass per area based around the fitted model.

```{r}
# Estimate means and confidence intervals
means_towers_transformed <- estimate_means(towers_transformed_fit, by = "log10_rainfall")

# make the plot
ggplot(data_towers_transformed, aes(x = log10_rainfall, y = log10_leaf_mass_per_area)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, col = "red", alpha = 0.2, stroke = 0) +
  geom_ribbon(data = means_towers_transformed, aes(ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high, y = Mean), fill = "grey") +
  geom_line(data = means_towers_transformed, aes(y = Mean), col = "#EB8240", linewidth = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    title = "Response of woody-plants to rainfall",
    x = "log10 Rainfall",
    y = "log10 Leaf Mass per Area"
  )
```


## Over to you

For the remainder of the practical, we will get you to: 

- load a dataset
- fit a linear model
- check their assumptions
- make changes to the data to improve the model fit and adherence to assumptions
- make some interpretations on the results of the model

We have not provided the step-by-step instructions / R code for you to complete these exercises. Use the knowledge you've gained so far and apply them here. Make use of your saved code from the previous pracs and the worked example above if you need some guidance.

# Examples

## Example 1: Growth rates vs. individual size

The file `data/GrowthRate.csv` contains 138 observations on the relationship between individual growth rate `GrowthRate` of a wide range of organisms and average individual weight `BodyWt` . The dataset contains species whose size varies over 14 orders of magnitude from approximately 10-9 to 106 g. 

> We want to know whether body weight affects growth rate in these species. 

**Exercise:**

Use R to:

- plot a graph of `GrowthRate` versus `BodyWt` with `ggplot2`
- make adjustments to your data, you may want to plot again to check whether your adjustments helped 
- conduct the linear regression analysis using `lm()` 
- evaluate whether your model fit is in line with the assumptions of a linear model using `check_model()`

Don't forget to load the packages you'll need to complete this exercise!

On your machine, you can load everything you need by running the following code:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(easystats)
```


```{r solution1}

# Read in data
data_growthrate <- read_csv("data/GrowthRate.csv")

# Plot raw data
ggplot(data_growthrate, aes(x = BodyWt, y = GrowthRate)) +
  geom_point() # Data is widespread and should be log10 transformed

# Fit a linear model
growth_bodywt_fit <- lm(GrowthRate ~ BodyWt, data = data_growthrate)

# Check model
check_model(growth_bodywt_fit)

# Transform data
data_growthrate_transformed <- data_growthrate |> 
  mutate(log10_bodywt = log10(BodyWt),
         log10_growthrate = log10(GrowthRate))

# Plot transformed data
ggplot(data_growthrate_transformed, aes(x = log10_bodywt, y = log10_growthrate)) +
  geom_point() 

# Fit a linear model
growth_bodywt_transformed_fit <- lm(log10_growthrate ~ log10_bodywt, data = data_growthrate_transformed)

# Check model
check_model(growth_bodywt_transformed_fit)
```

**Questions**
1. What is the equation for the linear model you are considering here?

`r cloze("GrowthRate = b0 + b1 * BodyWt", c("BodyWt = b0 + b1 * GrowthRate", "BodyWt = b0 + b1 + GrowthRate","GrowthRate = b0 + b1 * BodyWt", "GrowthRate = b0 + b1 + BodyWt"))`

2. Based on your plot of the raw data, what are some potential problems you see in fitting this linear model to these data? Select all that applies: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
possible_assumption_issues <- c("high variance in larger values", 
                                "there may be some outliers, but hard to tell because the data has a massive spread",
                                "the variables are non-normal",
                                "x and y may not follow a linear relationship", 
                                "All looks good to me")
```

The potential issues with fitting a linear model to this data include: 
`r cloze(c("high variance in larger values", "x and y may not follow a linear relationship", "there may be some outliers, but hard to tell because the data has a massive spread"), possible_assumption_issues)`

3. What transformation do you recommend for this dataset?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
possible_transformations <- c("log 10", "natural log", "square root", "log 10 (var + 0.1)")
```

A `r cloze("log 10", possible_transformations)` transformation is suited for this dataset because observation values vary by orders of magnitude. 

4. How did the transformation change the "Linearity" `check_model()` plot?

The log 10 transformation `r cloze("put the fitted and residual values on a similar scale so we can see them spread out", c("removed the outliers", "put the fitted and residual values on a similar scale so we can see them spread out", "made the results non-significant"))`

# Example 2: Brain weight vs. body size

![](images/brains.png)

The data file `data/Brain.csv` contains data on average brain weight for 62 species of mammals. The file presents body weight (kg) `BodyWt` and brain weight (g) `BrainWt` for each species.

> We wish to consider the problem of modelling brain weight (y response) as a function of body weight (x predictor). 

**Exercises:**

- Use R to draw a scatter plot of Brain weight versus Body weight. 
- Note down on any problem you see in fitting a linear model to these data.

```{r solution2}
# Read in data
data_brains <- read_csv("data/Brain.csv")

# Plot raw data
ggplot(data_brains, aes(x = BodyWt, y = BrainWt)) +
  geom_point() # Data is widespread and should be log10 transformed

# Fit a linear model
brains_bodywt_fit <- lm(BrainWt ~ BodyWt, data = data_brains)

# Check model
check_model(brains_bodywt_fit)

# Apply transformations
data_brains_transformed <- data_brains |> 
  mutate(log10_bodywt = log10(BodyWt),
         log10_brainwt = log10(BrainWt))

# Plot transformed data
ggplot(data_brains_transformed, aes(x = log10_bodywt, y = log10_brainwt)) +
  geom_point() 

# Refit model 
brains_bodywt_transformed_fit <- lm(log10_brainwt ~ log10_bodywt, data = data_brains_transformed)

# Check model
check_model(brains_bodywt_transformed_fit)

# Plot for Question 3.
ggplot(data_brains_transformed, aes(x = log10_bodywt, y = log10_brainwt)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = Species)) 
```

**Questions**

Find transformations of one or both variables so that on the transformed scale the regression is linear. 

1. Which transformation help create a more linear relationship? between x and y?

A `r cloze("log 10", possible_transformations)` transformation is suited for this dataset because observation values vary by orders of magnitude and the raw data appears `r cloze("somewhat non-linear", c("very linear", "somewhat non-linear"))`. 

2. Now, create a linear model with your transformed data. 

Examine the graph of residuals from your model versus fitted values. Comment on your residual plot comparing the linear model with untransformed data to the linear model with transformed data.

The normality of the residuals from our linear model `r cloze("increased", c("increased", "decreased"))` after performing a log 10 transformation. 

3. Humans are considered to be a big brained species. Is there evidence from the analysis to suggest that humans are an unusual species relative to the others? Could we consider it as an 'outlier'? You may need to create plot and use some clever labelling of points to answer this question

Looking at a plot of transformed data, the brain and body weight for Humans do appear to stand out. Based on our `r cloze("influential observations plot", c("qq-plot", "fitted vs residuals plot", "influential observations plot"))` of our `r cloze("transformed", c("transformed", "untransformed"))` data, Humans `r cloze("are not considered an outlier", c("are not considered an outlier", "is considered as an influential point and should be excluded"))`

## Example 3: Boiling point of water vs. air pressure

![Ever notice that water boils quicker at high altitudes? Image credit: Slower Hiking](images/boiling-water-at-elevation.jpg){60%}

In the 1840's, the Scottish physicist Dr James Forbes travelled to the Swiss Alps and made many measurements of how the boiling point of water varied with air pressure (which decreases with altitude). In his research paper , Forbes also presented data collected on the measures of the same two quantities by Dr Joseph Hooker (famous botanist, explorer, friend of Charles Darwin). Unlike Forbes, however, Hooker took his measurements in the Himalayan Mountains, generally at higher altitudes.

The data we will explore here are a subset of Hooker's data containg 31 observations:
- `Temperature` at boiling point of water (degrees Fahrenheit)
- `Pressure`, the corrected barometric pressure (inches of mercury). 

> We want to know whether changes in pressure (which decreases with altitude) affects the boiling point of water. 

Start by reading the data  `data/Hooker.csv` into R.

**Exercise:**

Use R to:

- plot a graph of Temperature versus Pressure with `ggplot2`
  - consider labelling your points with the row number of each value
- conduct the linear regression analysis using `lm()` (Temperature = a + b*Pressure)
- evaluate whether your model fit is in line with the assumptions of a linear model using `check_model()`

```{r solution3}

# Read in data
data_hooker <- read_csv("data/Hooker.csv")

# Plot raw data
data_hooker |> 
  mutate(obs_id = row_number()) |>  # Create a temporary variable that denotes the row number of each observation

ggplot(aes(x = Pressure, y = Temperature)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = obs_id)) + # A scatterplot where each point is the observation number
  theme_classic()

# Fit the model with all data
hooker_fit <- lm(Temperature ~ Pressure, data = data_hooker)

# Check model
check_model(hooker_fit)

# Exclude potential outlier
data_hooker_norow7 <- data_hooker |> 
   slice(-7)

# Fit the model with all data
hooker_norow7_fit <- lm(Temperature ~ Pressure, data = data_hooker_norow7)

# Check model
check_model(hooker_norow7_fit) # Not really improve things..

# Transform data instead
data_hooker_transformed <- data_hooker |> 
  mutate(log10_temp = log10(Temperature),
         log10_pressure = log10(Pressure))

# Fit the model with all data
hooker_transformed_fit <- lm(log10_temp ~ log10_pressure, data = data_hooker_transformed)

# Check model
check_model(hooker_transformed_fit) # There is an improvement but probably good to remove outlier

# Remove outlier in transformed data
data_hooker_transformed_norow7  <- data_hooker_transformed |> 
   slice(-7)

# Fit the model with all data
hooker_transformed_norow7_fit <- lm(log10_temp ~ log10_pressure, data = data_hooker_transformed_norow7)

# Check model
check_model(hooker_transformed_norow7_fit) # Heaps better!
```

**Questions**
1. When fitting a linear model on the raw data, which assumptions are violated? Select all that applies

```{r, echo=FALSE}
possible_violations <- c("there are potential outliers", 
                         "non-linear relationship present", 
                         "non-constant residual variance", 
                         "residuals are non-normal", 
                         "values are not independent", 
                         "values do not represent the population")
```

`r cloze(c("there are potential outliers", "non-linear relationship present", "non-constant residual variance") , possible_violations)`

2. You notice that point 7 looks a bit out of place. After some investigation, it turns out there were machinery issues when the data was recorded. You decide that's sufficient reason to exclude the point as an outlier. 

METHODS TO REMOVE ROWS OF A DATAFRAME

In `dplyr`, the function `slice` gives us a subset of rows by row number. Placing a minus `-` sign in front of that number will give us all rows **except** that one listed. To remove row 7, we would use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_hooker_norow7 <-  data_hooker |> slice(-7)
```

Another way to remove rows is to use the `filter()` function. To remove row 7, we would use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data_hooker_norow7 <- data_hooker |> filter(row_number() != 7)
``` 


What did removing the outliers do with adhering to model assumptions? 

Removing the outlier `r cloze("didn't improve very much", c("didn't improve very much", "drastically improved adherance to all model assumptions"))`

Rerun your linear model with your new dataset and check your model again

3. Removing the outlier didn't really help... let's try transforming the data. `log10` transform your x and y variable and rerun the linear model analysis and model checks

Recall to use `mutate()` to create a new variable containing your transformed data.

What is the fitted equation for this mode? 

The fitted equation for this model is:
log10(Temp) = `r cloze("1.9681",c("1.9681", "0.242507", "<2e-16"))`+ `r cloze("0.242507",c("1.9681", "0.242507", "<2e-16"))` * log10(Pressure)

4.  Look at the the residual plots from `check_model()` and compare it between: 

- a model with row 7
- a model without row 7
- a model with log transformed data with row 7

Can you see any evidence of outliers in the log-transformed data? What data adjustments would you recommend for a linear model for the Hooker dataset? 

Based on the influential observations plot, I recommend: 
- `r cloze("removing row 7", c("removing row 7", "retaining row 7", "remove row 1"))`
- apply a  `r cloze("log 10", possible_transformations)` transformation.

## Example 4 Body size vs fecundity

![](images/amphipods.jpeg){60%}

An evolutionary biologist was interested in body size-fecundity relationships in marine invertebrates. For most animals, larger females are able to produce more offspring per reproductive event. This is due to the levels of resources available for allocation to reproduction, and for species that brood their offspring, the physical constraints of housing the developing eggs or embryos.

Many crustaceans have indeterminate growth, which means they just keep on moulting and getting bigger until something kills them. Consequently, older and larger females can have many more offspring per reproductive event than smaller individuals. Amphipods are crustaceans that do not release their eggs into the plankton, but look after them in a brood pouch between their legs.

To explore how fecundity varied with body size, the biologist collected 40 females that were brooding eggs, measured their body length `Length` (mm) and the number of eggs `Eggs` in their brood pouch.

Load the data file `data/Amphipod.fecundity.csv` and choose a plot to visualise egg number per brood, you may want to label each point as the row number again.

```{r solution4}

# Read in data
data_amphipods <- read_csv("data/Amphipod_fecundity.csv")

# Plot raw data
data_amphipods |>
  mutate(obs_id = row_number()) |>  # Create a temporary variable that denotes the row number of each observation
ggplot(aes(x = Length, y = Eggs)) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = obs_id)) +
  theme_classic()

# Fit the model with all data
amphipods_fit <- lm(Eggs ~ Length, data = data_amphipods)

# Check model
check_model(amphipods_fit)

# Exclude potential outlier
data_amphipods_norow40 <- data_amphipods |> 
   slice(-40)

# Fit the model with all data
amphipods_norow40_fit <- lm(Eggs ~ Length, data = data_amphipods_norow40) 

# Check model
check_model(amphipods_norow40_fit) # Looks pretty good!

# Interpret model output
parameters(amphipods_norow40_fit)
summary(amphipods_norow40_fit)
```

**Questions**

1. What analysis would you use to describe the relationship between body length and egg number per brood?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
possible_analyses <- c("linear regression",
                       "independent samples t-test", "goodness of fit test", "paired t-test")
```

The suitable analysis would be `r cloze("linear regression" ,possible_analyses)` because we are trying to understand the relationship between two continuous variables 

Run the suitable analysis. Check your model assumptions and make any data adjustments you see fit then answer the following:

2.  What is the probability that there is no relationship between body size and body length?

The probability that there is no relationship between body size and body length is `r cloze("< .001", c("0.05", "0.01", "< .001"))`

3. How many more eggs are produced per brood for every 1 mm increase in body length?

For every 1 mm increase in body length in an amphipod, we see an average `r cloze("increase", c("increase", "decrease"))` of `r cloze("6.34", c("6.34", "31.02"))` eggs. 

4. How many eggs would you predict that a 10 mm female would have?

The fitted equation of our model is:

`r cloze("number of eggs (fecundity)", c("number of eggs (fecundity)", "body length"))` = `r cloze("-31.02", c("6.34", "-31.02"))` +  `r cloze("6.34", c("6.34", "-31.02"))` * `r cloze("number of eggs (fecundity)", c("number of eggs (fecundity)", "body length"))`

Substituting 10mm in place of `r cloze("number of eggs (fecundity)", c("number of eggs (fecundity)", "body length"))` in the fitted equation will give us `r cloze("32.38", c("32.38", "-1966.668", "-94.42"))` eggs

5. What percentage of the variance in egg number per brood is explained by your relationship?

The `r cloze("R-squared", c("p-value", "t-value", "F-statistic", "R-squared"))` value tells us our model explains `r cloze("76%", c("24%", "58%", "76%"))`

## Example 5: River flow and density of larval fish

![](images/retropinna-semoni-cropped.jpg) <br>

River managers want to know if there is an difference in the numbers of fish recruiting under different environmental flow practices. They go out to a number of different locations along a river of interest and measure the density of larval fishes and water flow rate (velocity m/s) at each site.

Load the data file `data/riverflow.csv` and choose a plot to visualise the relationship between flow rate `Flow.rate` and density of fish larvae `Larvae.density`.

```{r solution5}

# Read in data
data_riverflow <- read_csv("data/riverflow.csv")

# Plot raw data
ggplot(data_riverflow, aes(x = Flow.rate, y = Larvae.density)) +
  geom_point() 

# Fit a linear model
riverflow_fit <- lm(Larvae.density ~ Flow.rate, data = data_riverflow)

# Check model
check_model(riverflow_fit) # Not bad!

# Inspect model summmaries
parameters(riverflow_fit)
summary(riverflow_fit)
```

**Questions**

1. What analysis would you use to describe the relationship between flow velocity and fish larvae density?

The suitable analysis would be `r cloze("linear regression" ,possible_analyses)` because we are trying to understand the relationship between two continuous variables 

Run the suitable analysis. Check your model assumptions and make any data adjustments you see fit then answer the following:

2. What is the probability that there is no relationship between fish larvae density and water flow velocity?

The probability that there is no relationship between fish larvae density and water flow velocity is `r cloze("0.023", c("0.05", "0.023", "< .001"))`

3. How many more fish larvae are present for every unit increase in flow velocity?

Our model suggests that larvae density `r cloze("decreased", c("increased", "decreased"))` by `r cloze("3.13", c("3.13", "7.49"))` units for every unit increase in flow velocity.

4. What percentage of the variance in larvae fish density is explained by your relationship?

The `r cloze("R-squared", c("p-value", "t-value", "F-statistic", "R-squared"))` value tells us our model explains `r cloze("15%", c("15%", "12%", "76%"))`

## Example 6: Koalas and fire regimes

![](images/koala-fires.jpeg){60%}

A group of forest managers want to know if there is any difference in the numbers of koalas under control fire practices. To do this, they surveyed the number of koalas from mixed Eucalyptus forest with varying species composition due to fire history. They then found records of the most recent fire at each survey site to use as a measure of fire disturbance.

Load the data file `data/koalas.csv` and choose a plot to visualise the number of koalas observed `Koalas` and years since fire `Year.last.fire`.

```{r solution6}

# Read in data
data_koalas <- read_csv("data/koalas.csv")

# Plot raw data
ggplot(data_koalas, aes(x = Year.last.fire, y = Koalas)) +
  geom_point() 

# Fit a linear model
koalas_fit <- lm(Koalas ~ Year.last.fire, data = data_koalas)

# Check model
check_model(koalas_fit) # Not bad!

# Inspect model summmaries
parameters(koalas_fit)
summary(koalas_fit)
```


**Questions**

1. What analysis would you use to describe the relationship between the number of koalas observed and the year of the most recent fire?

The suitable analysis would be `r cloze("linear regression" ,possible_analyses)` because we are trying to understand the relationship between two continuous variables 

Run the suitable analysis. Check your model assumptions and make any data adjustments you see fit then answer the following:

2. What is the sign and value of the slope from our model?

The slope from our model is `r cloze("negative", c("negative", "positive"))` and its value is `r cloze("0.21", c("0.21", "0.03", "0.001", "424.82"))`.

3. How do you interpret the the sign and slope of our model?

For every year since a bushfire, the number of koalas `r cloze("decreased", c("increased", "decreased"))` by 0.21. 
5. What is the probability that there is no relationship between the year of the most recent fire and the number of koalas?

The probability that there is no relationship between the year of the most recent fire and the number of koalas is `r cloze("< .001", c("0.05", "0.023", "< .001"))`

6. What percentage of the variance in koala numbers is explained by the year of the most recent fire?

The `r cloze("R-squared", c("p-value", "t-value", "F-statistic", "R-squared"))` value tells us our model explains `r cloze("34%", c("15%", "34%", "76%"))`

# Intro

## Introduction

In this session, weâ€™ll explore XXXX.


Weâ€™ll learn how xxx. By the end, youâ€™ll be equipped to apply GLMs to your own data!

## Key learning objectives

Our learning objective today are:

- 

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸš€ 

## Setting up: Materials

Everything you need for this prac is on Moodle

1. Download this week's materials zip file from Moodle, from the course page
2. Unzip the file by: 
  - MacOS: Double clicking the zipfile 
  - Windows: Right click on the zip file and click "Extract All" 
3. Move the extracted folder into the folder where you store materials for `BEES2041/` 
4. **Click on the Rstudio project file, eg. `Wk7-Multivariate.Rproj`** to open the RStudio project and you're in!!!

We will be working with various datasets collected. These are in the folder `data/`.

You will work in the relevant Quarto document for this prac. Within each Quarto docs there are several challenges for you to complete on your own devices in order to **answer the questions on Moodle**.

## Setting up: Packages

> **Note** that when running R in the browser we need to install the packages each time we start a new session or after you've checked your answers. We're only going to install the parts of `tidyverse` we need for this prac.

We'll also be using a new package, called `vegan`, which is XXX

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("vegan")
```

> Remember to load the packages into R to use em!

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(vegan)
```

# Single hask for major setcions

## Use a double hash for each question

How to include an image

![](images/Beach.jpeg){width=70%}

This is how you... 
```{r}
# Code you want to display
```

Example of a cloze question 

The p-value is `r cloze("0.011", c("0.011", "0.1", "11"))`. This indicates there is relatively `r cloze("low", c("low", "high"))` chance that there is no relationship between the presence of bacteria _H. influenzae_ and weeks.


```{r solution1}
# label chunk solution1,2,3, etc with solutions, and code you want to remove

```

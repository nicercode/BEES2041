,,
,suffix ‘_p’ , the value extracted from the exact single pixel the observation lies on
,suffix ‘_s’ ," the mean value calculated from a group of neighbourhood pixels (a spectrally homogenous segment, e.g. coral patch, sand patch)"
,suffix ‘_savg’ , the ‘sum average’ glcm texture metric for the corresponding band
,suffix ‘_maxent’ , the ‘maximum entropy’ glcm texture metric for the corresponding band

# Week 1 First Practical

## Set up R packages

```{r}
# install.packages(c("readr", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "skimr", "janitor"))
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
# library(dplyr)
# library(skimr)
# library(janitor)
```

## Stalagmite data

Stalagmites are mineral formations that grow in caves, preserving environmental records in their layered structure. Paleoclimatologists from the [Climate Change Research Centre](https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/ccrc) collected this data. The thickness of each lamina reflects past climate conditions—thicker layers often indicate wetter periods, while thinner ones suggest drier times. By analysing lamina thickness and age, scientists can reconstruct past climate patterns, track seasonal variations, and identify historical environmental events.\
\
This dataset contains laminated stalagmite measurements, with 40,279 records. It includes the following columns:

-   `entity_id`: Identifier for the stalagmite sample.
-   `seq_id`: Sequence identifier (likely referring to sample grouping).
-   `lamina thickness (mm)`: Thickness of individual laminae in millimeters.
-   `lam_age (BP, 0=1950AD)`: Age of the lamina in years before present (BP), with 0 corresponding to 1950 AD.

```{r}
stalagmite_data <- read_csv("data/Laminated stalagmite Dataset.csv")
```

> You may find it helpful to use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` R package first before delving in. You may need to install this package first. Remember to use `library(janitor)` to load this package into R, put this code in the first R chunk!

```{r}
stalagmite_data_nice_names <- stalagmite_data |> janitor::clean_names()

stalagmite_data_nice_names
```

Using the functions you've learned so far in this prac, try to answer the following questions:

**Questions:**

**How many rows and columns are in `stalagmite_data`?**

```{r}
dim(stalagmite_data_nice_names) # or look in Environment Pane
```

**What type of variable is `lamina_thickness_mm`?**

```{r}
str(stalagmite_data_nice_names)
```

**What type of variable is `lam_age_bp_0_1950ad`?**

```{r}
str(stalagmite_data_nice_names)
```

**What is a more suitable variable type for `lam_age_bp_0_1950ad`?**

Integer because the values are whole numbers

**Write some code to change the variable type of `lam_age_bp_0_1950ad`? (Try: `?as.integer` , you may need to install/load the package `dplyr`** )

```{r}
# Without dplyr
# Make a copy of the dataset 
stalagmite_data_nice_names_corrected_age <- stalagmite_data_nice_names
# Change variable type
stalagmite_data_nice_names_corrected_age$lam_age_bp_0_1950ad <- as.integer(stalagmite_data_nice_names_corrected_age$lam_age_bp_0_1950ad)

# dplyr
# install.packages(dplyr)
library(dplyr)
stalagmite_data_nice_names_corrected_age <- stalagmite_data_nice_names |> 
  mutate(lam_age_bp_0_1950ad = as.integer(lam_age_bp_0_1950ad))

stalagmite_data_nice_names_corrected_age
```

**Write some code to display a quick summary of this dataset (Feel free to use additional packages! You may need to install and load them first)**

```{r}
summary(stalagmite_data_nice_names_corrected_age)

# install.packages(skimr)
library(skimr)
skim(stalagmite_data_nice_names_corrected_age)

```

## Sydney Beaches

![Image credit: Amazing Aerial](images/coogee-beach.jpeg){width=100%}Sydney-siders LOVE their beaches and want to know the best swimming locations. A team of environmental scientists from the School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences collected a dataset containing water quality measurements for Sydney beaches. It includes records of enterococci levels (cfu per 100ml) across a number of years, along with geographic coordinates. Enterococci levels are used as an indicator of water pollution and safety for swimming.

> We want to try to answer the question **which beach is the "cleanest" in Sydney?**, we'll be using the dataset `sydneybeaches.csv`

First, read in the data.

```{r}
syd_beach_data <- read_csv("data/sydneybeaches.csv") |> clean_names()

```

**Questions:**

**Check the structure to make sure the variable types were assigned correctly.**

```{r}
str(syd_beach_data)
```

**Which of these variables were their data type assigned incorrectly?**

**Change `Enterococci_cfu_per_100ml` to an integer variable.**

```{r}
# Without dplyr
# Make a copy of the dataset 
syd_beach_data_corrected_entero <- syd_beach_data
# Change variable type
syd_beach_data_corrected_entero$enterococci_cfu_per_100ml <- as.integer(syd_beach_data_corrected_entero$enterococci_cfu_per_100ml)

# dplyr
# install.packages(dplyr)
library(dplyr)
syd_beach_data_corrected_entero <- syd_beach_data |> 
  mutate(enterococci_cfu_per_100ml = as.integer(enterococci_cfu_per_100ml))

syd_beach_data_corrected_entero
```

Use this newly formatted data to visualise the amount of bacteria found at each `Site.`

To make the plot, replace the terms `your_data`, `x_variable`, and `y_variable` with your choice of variables relevant to your question. Using the `dplyr` package here is advised. You may need to:

-   Exclude a potential outlier or not ;) - try both!

-   Apply a transformation on `Enterococci_cfu_per_100ml` e.g `sqrt()` or `log10(Enterococci_cfu_per_100ml + 1`) - try both!

-   Try `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_violin()` with `geom_point()`

```{r}
# Transform Enterococci_cfu_per_100ml
# Sqrt
syd_beach_data_corrected_entero_with_transformation <- 
  syd_beach_data_corrected_entero |> 
  mutate(sqrt_enterococci_cfu_per_100ml = sqrt(enterococci_cfu_per_100ml),
         log10plus1_enterococci_cfu_per_100ml = log10(enterococci_cfu_per_100ml + 1))

# Create a useful plot
## Box plot 
# Sqrt
ggplot(syd_beach_data_corrected_entero_with_transformation, aes(x = site, y = sqrt_enterococci_cfu_per_100ml)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 7)) # Align the axes labels nicely

# Log 10 transformation
ggplot(syd_beach_data_corrected_entero_with_transformation, aes(x = site, y = log10plus1_enterococci_cfu_per_100ml)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 7)) # Align the axes labels nicely

## Violin plots
# Sqrt
ggplot(syd_beach_data_corrected_entero_with_transformation, aes(x = site, y = sqrt_enterococci_cfu_per_100ml)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 7)) # Align the axes labels nicely

# Log 10 transformation
ggplot(syd_beach_data_corrected_entero_with_transformation, aes(x = site, y = log10plus1_enterococci_cfu_per_100ml)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_point() + 
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 7)) # Align the axes labels nicely
```

**Questions:**

**Why did we need to transform the data?**

**What does the shape of the violin plot tell us about the data?**

**...and finally, which Sydney beach would you go swimming?**

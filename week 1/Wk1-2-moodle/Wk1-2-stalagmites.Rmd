<h1>stalagmites - Overview</h1>

[Stalagmites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalagmite) are a type of rock formation that rises from the floor of a cave due to the accumulation of material deposited on the floor from ceiling drippings.

Prof Andy Baker in the UNSW School of Biological, Earth & Environmental Sciences uses stalgmite growth rates to study patterns of rainfall. As stalagmite growth rates depend on the rate of water flow into the soil, records of growth can be used to reconstruct rainfall variability through time.

This section builds off two papers published by Andy and his team:

-   Baker et al (2021). The properties of annually laminated stalagmites-A global synthesis. Reviews of Geophysics, 59, e2020RG000722. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020RG000722 (see file `doc/Baker et al 2021 Reviews of Geophysics.pdf`

-   Baker et al (2015). A composite annual-resolution stalagmite record of North Atlantic climate over the last three millennia (see file `doc/Baker et al 2015.pdf`)

**Activity:**

Andy asked us to cross check his results, your goal is reproduce some key figures from the paper 2021 paper.

**Do these visualisations in your `Wk1-2-stalagmites.qmd` document**

> In some code chunks, we've given you some partialy completed R code, these are hints, complete the rest of the code before you run them

## Setting up 

Try running this first and see if you get alerts about missing packages. You may need to uncomment the first line and install any packages you don't have. 


```{r}
# install.packages(c("tidyverse", "janitor", "readxl"))

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
```

## Loading data

<h3>Loading data</h3>

The data is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Laminated_stalagmite_Dataset_csv/13166639

We've downloaded this into the folder at `data/stalagmites/Laminated stalagmite Dataset.csv`

Load this into R use the `read_csv()` function.

The code below get's you started. You'll need to fill in the spaces indicated by XXX.


```{r}
stalagmites_data <- read_csv("data/XXX")
```


## Data structure

<h3>Data structure</h3>

This dataset contains laminated stalagmite measurements, with 40,279 records. It includes the following columns:

-   `entity_id`: Identifier for the stalagmite sample.
-   `seq_id`: Sequence identifier (likely referring to sample grouping).
-   `lamina thickness (mm)`: Thickness of individual laminae in millimeters.
-   `lam_age (BP, 0=1950AD)`: Age of the lamina in years before present (BP), with 0 corresponding to 1950 AD.

Check the structure of the dataset, including the names of the columns. 

```{r}
names(stalagmites_data)
```


> This dataset has some difficult variable names.`clean_names()` from the package `janitor` may be useful here. 


```{r}
stalagmites_data <- read_csv("data/XXX") |>
  clean_names()
```


## Check the data

<h3>Check the data</h3>

**Question: Did you notice any errors in the dataset? There is one really weird value in `lamina_thickness_mm`. Which is it? Try spot it using `geom_boxplot()`**

The code below get's you started. You'll need to fill in the spaces indicated by XXX.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = stalagmites_data, aes(y = lamina_thickness_mm)) + 
  geom_XXX()
```

You check with Andy and he confirms an error in the data entry for this point. Can you remove it?

The `filter()` function and the `!` exclusion operator could be useful here.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stalagmites_data <- stalagmites_data |> 
  filter(! XXX )
```

> Now let's go ahead and make some plots. We're going to try and recreate figures similar to Figure 3, 5, 10 in Baker et al 2021. Don't worry about getting them exact, just close.

## Figure 5

<h3>Figure 5</h3>

Have a go at creating this plot in  your `Wk1-2-stalagmites.qmd` document. Add some colours/fill and nice axes labels. Use the `xlim()` function to see the max value for the x axis

![Figure 5](baker-fig5.png)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
stalagmites_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = lamina_thickness_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs() +
  xlim()
```

**Question: Interpret this plot, what does this visualisation tell us?** 

The annual lamina growth rate is  `r cloze("very slow", c("very fast", "very slow"))` in the majority of samples.

## Figure 3

<h3>Figure 3</h3>

Have a go at creating this plot.

![Figure 3](baker-fig3.png)

<br>

> Try making a single panel before making a bunch of panels.

1. Start with single sample. Use the `filter()` function to subset your data before plotting it. You may need to log10 + 1 transform your y variable to . Add some nice axes labels.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Transform data
transformed_stalagmites_data <- stalagmites_data |> 
  mutate(log10_1_lamina_thickness_mm = log10(lamina_thickness_mm + 1))

# Create plot
transformed_stalagmites_data |>
  filter( XXX ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = lam_age_bp_0_1950ad, y = XXX )) +
  geom_line() +
  labs() + 
  theme_classic()
```

2. Now try making a panel of plots. Note the section in the intro on faceting will be helpful for multipanel plots.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
transformed_stalagmites_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = XXX, y = XXX)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_classic() +
  labs("Years BP", y = "Growth rate (mm/yr)") + 
  facet_wrap( ~ entity_id, scales = "free")
```

**Question: Interpret this plot, what does this visualisation tell us?**

The annual growth of all lamina samples are `r cloze("highly variable", c("very consistent", "highly variable"))`

## Figure 10

<h3>Figure 10</h3>

Have a go at creating this plot. 

![Figure 10](baker-fig10.png)

<br>

You'll need to extract data for the samples numbers in black with `seq_id` before plotting. Using the **`%in%`** operator to filter for specific sequences.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Check vector of seq_id that you want 
ids <- c(85, 1004, 385, 217.1, 1008.1, 128, 465, 217.2, 1007.2, 128,  466, 1009.2, 1003.1, 1006)

# Create plot
transformed_stalagmites_data |> 
  filter(seq_id %in% ids) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = XXX ,y = XXX)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ seq_id, scales = "free") +
  labs("Years BP", y = "Growth rate (mm/yr)")
```


##  Figure 2

<h3>Figure 2</h3>

Finally, can you plot a map of sample locations as in figure 2?

![Figure 2](baker-fig2.png)

<br>

The data with locations is in `data/stalagmites/Tables.xlsx`. It's an excel file. We can read it in using the `read_xlsx()` from the package `readxl`. You may need to install this. You might also want to clean up the variable names

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stalagmites_sites <- read_xlsx("data/stalagmites/Tables.xlsx") |> clean_names()
```

**Question: Did you notice any errors in the dataset? There is one row isn't data, which is it?**

`r cloze("first row", c("third row", "first row", "last row"))`

```{r}
stalagmites_sites
```

Exclude this row using the `filter`() function

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stalagmites_sites <- stalagmites_sites |> filter(! )
```

**Question: Are `lat` and `long` variables correct type? If not, correct this using the suitable function e.g. `as.numeric()`**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stalagmites_sites <- stalagmites_sites |> 
  mutate(lat = XXX),
         long = XXX)
```

First, let's make a map using the standard ggplot. I'll start you off with code for a world map. Your job is to add points and site names with `geom_text()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# create data for world coordinates using
# map_data() function
world_coordinates <- map_data("world")

# create world map using ggplot() function
stalagmites_sites |>
  ggplot(
    aes(long, lat)) +
  geom_map(data = world_coordinates, map = world_coordinates,  # geom_map() function takes world coordinates  as input to plot world map
           aes(long, lat, map_id = region)) +  
  coord_quickmap() +
  theme_classic()
```

<h3>BONUS</h3>

R is a powerhouse for creating really cool outputs. For fun, here we've provided code for you to create an interactive map application. You will use the package `leaflet`. The code is a little different, don't worry about the details here - we just want to use you the possibilities of R!


```{r, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages(c("leaflet"))

library(leaflet)

leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  addMarkers(
    lng = stalagmites_sites$long,
    lat = stalagmites_sites$lat,
    label =
      paste(
        stalagmites_sites$entity_id_1000_sisal_entity_id,
        stalagmites_sites$site_name
      )
  )	|>
  addScaleBar()
```

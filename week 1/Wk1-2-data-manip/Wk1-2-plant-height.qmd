## Overview

![](trees.png){width="60%"}

Professor Angela Moles, a professor here at UNSW, used an open-source dataset of maximum height data for 7084 plant species and site combinations to provide the first global, cross-species quantification of the latitudinal gradient in plant height. (You can read more about the original study at [doi:10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01526.x](doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01526.x) or in `docs/Journal of Ecology - 2009 - Moles - Global patterns in plant height.pdf`)

We are going to use this data to do a bit of preliminary analyses and see if we can answer two questions:

**1. How does plant height vary across a latitudinal gradient (from tropics to the poles)?**

**2. Are there taller plants at higher altitudes?**

**Activities:**

-   Read in data and wrangle it suited for visualisation

-   Create data visualisation that can address the questions

-   Draw some initial conclusions from the plots you create

## Setting up

```{r}

```

## Assembling the Data

Read in the dataset `plantHeightSingleSpp.csv` from the folder `data/plant_height/`. There are some case and seperator inconsistencies in the column names. Clean these up as you read in the data using the `|>` pipe.

```{r}

```

WOAH there are a LOT of variables in this data set. Sometimes it's nice to select only the columns you need for your analysis. This can make things easier in the long-run. Luckily, `dplyr` can help with that!

**Question: Which columns are relevant to these 2 questions? Select all that apply [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**

Now, create a new data frame with only the relevant columns using `select()`

```{r}

```

## Check the distribution for the data

Check the distribution of your data to make sure there are no potential outliers in your key variables.

**Question: What plot would be good for this check? [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**

```{r}

```

**Question: Is `height` left skewed or right skewed? [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**


**Question: Which species is the extreme value? Is the extreme value a true outlier? (Do some research and see verify this value) [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**


```{r}

```

## Data transformation

It is common to transform your data when its heavily skewed as in `height`, can you `log10()` transform `height` and assign this update into a new data frame.

```{r}

```

## Visualisation

**Question: What should be the x variable and what should be the y variable? [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**

We'll first create a `ggplot` showing `lat` on the `x`-axis and `height` on the `y`-axis. Then, we'll create the same figure but using the `log10` transformed data to see how it changes the patterns.

> Create a plot to visualise the relationship between latitude and height.

**Question: What type of plot is suited to visualise these two variables? [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**


```{r}

```

Let's take a look at the line of best fit! To add this to our figure, use `geom_smooth(method="lm")`.

```{r}

```

Now create the same plot but using your `log10()` transformed variable instead of `height` and include the line of best fit.

```{r}

```

**Question: 1. How does plant height vary across a latitudinal gradient (from tropics to the poles)? [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**

> Now, we are going to try to answer our second question; Does plant height increase as **altitude** increases?

## Altitude

We will continue to use the `log10` transformed `height`

Make a plot that can help us answer question 2. - add the line of best fit.

```{r}

```

**Question: 2. Are there taller plants at higher altitudes? [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**

## Prac reflection

**Question: Which parts of the coding and the tidyverse you've encountered so far did you find: [ANSWER IN MOODLE]**

-   most exciting?
-   most challenging?

# Introduction to Linear Regression with Multiple predictors

## Introduction

Welcome back! So far in our linear models, we have been working with linear or generalised linear models with a **single predictor** (i.e x variable) to explain variation in the response variable. While **single predictors** are straightforward to understand for simple experimental designs, we often need **more than one predictor** to help us capture real-world complexity to answer our research questions. 

First let's briefly recap on variable types, as this will determine the choice of analyses you will do: 

- **continuous variable** is a numerical variable that can take any value within a range, including decimals. e.g `bill_length_mm`

- **categorical variable** is a variable (AKA discrete variable) that represents distinct groups e.g. `islands` `species`

![](images/continuous-discrete.png){width=60%}

Today, we will go through three different use cases that have different combinations of predictor variables: 

1. Two **categorical** predictors 
    - main additive effects
    - interactive effects 
2. Two **continuous** predictors
    - main additive effects
    - interactive effects 
3. One **categorical** predictor, one continuous predictor

> Note in all use cases today, our response variable (y) is continuous.

## Key learning objectives

Our learning objectives today are:

- **understand** how different predictor variable types can influence your choice of analysis 
- **understand** difference between additive and interactive effects
- **run** a multiple linear regression in R using `lm()`
- **test** for effects of your predictor variables using `anova()`
- **interpret** the output of your multiple regression using `parameters()`, `estimate_means()`, `estimate_contrasts()`
- **extract** the mean and confidence interval for the slope and intercept of the regression line
- **plot** the data and the regression line with confidence intervals

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸš€ 

## Setting up: Materials

Everything you need for this prac is on Moodle

1. Download this week's materials zip file from Moodle, from the course page
2. Unzip the file by: 
  - MacOS: Double clicking the zipfile 
  - Windows: Right click on the zip file and click "Extract All" 
3. Move the extracted folder into the folder where you store materials for `BEES2041/` 
4. **Click on the Rstudio project file, eg. `Wk5-1-multi-regression.Rproj`** to open the RStudio project and you're in!!!

We will be working with various datasets collected. These are in the folder `data/`.

You will work in the relevant Quarto document for this prac. Within each Quarto docs there are several challenges for you to complete on your own devices in order to **answer the questions on Moodle**.

## Setting up: Packages

> **Note** that when running R in the browser we need to install the packages each time we start a new session or after you've checked your answers. We're only going to install the parts of `tidyverse` and `easystats` we need for this prac.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("performance")
install.packages("modelbased")
install.packages("see")
install.packages("emmeans")
install.packages("patchwork")
```

> Remember to load the packages into R to use em!

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(performance)
library(modelbased)
library(patchwork)
```

# Use case 1: Two **categorical** predictors (Two-way ANOVA)

Some research designs are interested in the effects of **two categorical variables** on the continuous response variable. In these instances, we use **Two-way ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) - a statistical method that help us to examine:

- **Main effects** â€“ The **independent impact** of each categorical variable on the outcome.

- **Interaction effect** â€“ Whether the **effect of one variable depends on the level of the other**.

> Recall that ANOVA at their core, are linear models. 

This means that we can fit a **two-way ANOVA** using the `lm()` function

Using `anova()` on the model fit object, we can **test whether the overall main effect and interaction effect the predictors are important** or not.

We can also look at the output of using `parameters()` to see **HOW big the main/interactive effect** is. 

## Worked Example: Penguin body mass by sex and species

![](images/palmer_penguins.png){width=60%}

We are all familiar with the Palmer Penguins by now, let's get to know them better with multiple regression. 

**Our research question: How much does body mass vary by sex and penguin species?**

The **continuous response** variable (y) is: `body_mass_mm`
The **two categorical predictor** variables (x1, x2) are: `sex` and `species`

First, let's exclude the penguins where `sex` is NA. These are juvenille penguins that won't contribute to answering our question.

```{r}
data_penguins_adults <- penguins |>
  filter(!is.na(sex)) # Exclude sex when its NA

summary(data_penguins_adults) # Get an overview of data
```

Now with our data all prepped, we can fit our linear model for our **two-way ANOVA**. 
Based on **our research question: How much does body mass vary by sex and penguin species?**, we want determine the **main effects** of sex and species, as well as their **interactive effects**. 

This is how we fit our two-way ANOVA:

```{r}
fit_penguin_adults <- lm(body_mass_g ~ sex + species + sex:species, data = data_penguins_adults)
```

> Let's talk through the predictors, including: 

- `sex` as a standalone predictor means we are interested in the sole effect of sex on body mass
- `species` as a standalone predictor means we are interested in the sole effect of species on body mass
- `sex:species` means we are interested in the **interactive effects** of both sex and species. In other words, the effect on body mass may depend sex AND species.

Let's estimate the mean of body mass by sex and species using our model with `estimate_means()` and plot them with the raw data 

```{r}
# Estimate mean of response for sex and species
means_penguin_adults <- estimate_means(fit_penguin_adults, by=c("sex", "species"))

means_penguin_adults
```

Here we are creating violin plots and adding some jitter to the raw data. We added error bars and the mean for each sex and we facetted the plot by species

> Notice we are calling `means_penguin_adults` in `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_point()` as we want to plot the mean body mass and their associated CIs. 

```{r}
ggplot(data_penguins_adults, aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g, fill = sex, col = sex)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +
  geom_errorbar(data = means_penguin_adults, aes(y = Mean, ymin = CI_low, ymax = CI_high),col = "black", width = 0.2) + 
  geom_point(data = means_penguin_adults, aes(y = Mean), col = "black") + 
  labs(
    x = "Sex",
    y = "Body Mass (g)"
  ) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  facet_wrap(~species)  +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 
```

Let's proceed with our two-way ANOVA to test whether we have the main effects of sex and species and their interaction contributes to variation in body mass.

## ANOVA output

To run a two way ANOVA, we call `anova(fit_penguin_adults)`

What can we see? 

```{r}
anova(fit_penguin_adults) 
```

We can see our predictor variables listed as rows. **Each row tests whether an effect signficantly affects body mass**. 

- The first rows for  the main effect of `sex`
- The second row for the main effect of ` species` after main effect of `sex`
- The third row for the interactive effect of `sex` and `species` after the two main effects.

This output tells us that both the **main effects** of sex and species and their **interactive effects** have a strong effect on body mass variation in Palmer penguins. 
**Questions:**

**1. Looking at the values for Mean Sq / F value, can you deduce which main effect explains has a stronger effect on body mass?**

The Sum Sq/Mean Sq values for `sex` are smaller/larger than the Sum Sq/Mean Sq values for `species`. This means that sex/species has a stronger/weaker effect on body mass

**2. Which of the three effects are contributing significantly to variation on body mass? (Select all that applies)**

`sex`
`species`
`sex:species`

> But how big are the effects of sex, species and their interactive effects on body mass? How much difference in body mass are we talking about?

## Model output

Typically when we are working with categorical predictors, we look at the ANOVA output first to determine whether there is an effect of a predictor before looking at the model output using `paramaters(fit_penguin_adults)`. 

The output of `parameters(fit_penguin_adults)` gives us a snapshot of the how big of the effect of sex and species for a reference group (female Adelie) but this is not particularly useful. 

> In our penguins study here, the **reference group are the female Adelie** penguins. **The coefficient is 3368.84 is the mean body mass for female Adelie penguins**.

```{r}
parameters(fit_penguin_adults)
```

Knowing this important fact about the `Intercept`, we can start to interpret the other rows in this model output. Recall that in a linear model containing categorical predictors, each row represents the **difference relative to the reference group due to that specific predictor**. 

For example:

- `sex [male] Ã— species [Chinstrap]` is the **difference in mean body mass between the Intercept (female Adelie) and male Chinstrap penguins (-262.89)**. This value is negative, implying the male Chinstraps are smaller than the Intercept (female Adelie).

**Questions:**

**3. What does `sex [male] Ã— species [Gentoo]` represent?**

The coefficient for `sex [male] Ã— species [Gentoo]` is 130.44/-262.89/1310.91. This represents the difference in/p-value for mean body mass between female Adelie/Chinstrap/Gentoo penguins and male Gentoo/Adelie/Chinstrap penguins.

**4. Interpret the p-value for `species [Gentoo]`**

The p-value for `species [Gentoo]` is < .001/0.014/0.089. This indicates that the probability for finding the difference of 1310.91/3368.84/674.66 in mean body mass between female/male Gentoo penguins and female/male Adelie pengions is very low/high.

## Contrasts

After establishing that there are main and interactive effects on body mass, we may want to use model to get some estimates of differences between sex and species using `estimate_contrasts()`

What's useful is that you can estimate constrasts for a main effect while holding the other effects constant. 

For example, here we are calculating the difference between the sexes and taking an average over each species (**main effect of sex**)

```{r}
estimate_contrasts(fit_penguin_adults, contrast = c("sex"))
```

Or we can calculate the difference between the species taking an average over sexes (**main effect of species**)

```{r}
estimate_contrasts(fit_penguin_adults, contrast = c("species"))
```

Importantly, for our **interaction effect** we can also estimate the difference between sexes for each species 

```{r}
estimate_contrasts(fit_penguin_adults, contrast = "sex", by = "species")
```

and the difference between species for each sex
```{r}
estimate_contrasts(fit_penguin_adults, contrast = "species", by = "sex")
```

**Questions:**

5. In  the contrasts between species for each sex, which differences are non-significant?

For both female and male penguins, the difference between Chinstrap/Gentoo and Adelie were non-significant/significant.

6. What does the 95% CI represent for `female | Gentoo` penguins? 

The 95% CI internal for `female | Gentoo` penguins represents the range of values where we would find the true population estimate of body mass for female/male Gentoo/Chinstrap/Adelie penguins 95% of the time.

## Reporting results

**Our research question was how much does body mass vary by sex and penguin species?**

Let's report on our findings. 

There was a **significant main effect of sex** on body mass, F(1, 327) = 406.15, p < .001, indicating that males and females penguins differ in body mass.

<!-- Ignore this header as it is an essay question -->
## Report on the main effect of `species` {type=essay}
**Report on the main effect of `species`** 

_ANOVA_

We found a  **significant interaction effect between sex and species**, F(2, 327) = 8.76, p < .001, indicating that the difference in body mass between males and females penguins depends on the species.

Overall, our multiple linear regression model explained R^2 = 28%/64%/85% of variation in body mass. 

_Contrasts_

Generally female/male pengiuns are smaller than male penguins (mean difference = 630.51, 95% CI = 560.27 - 700.75, p-value = <0.001). 

<!-- Ignore this header as it is an essay question -->
## Report on the contrasts of `species` {type=essay}
**Report on the contrasts of `species`** 

There were no statistical differences in body mass male Chinstrap and male Adelie penguins (Chinstrap-Adelie = -104.52g, 95% CI = -230.90 - 21.85, p-value =  0.105). There were marginal differences in body mass between female Chinstrap and female Adelie penguins (Chinstrap-Adelie = 158.37, 95% CI = 31.99 - 284.7, p-value = 0.014). All other pairwise combinations were highly significant. See Figure 1 above.

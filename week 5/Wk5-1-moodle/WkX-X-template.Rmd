motivation.....Wrangling your data into the right format is a critical step to data visualisation and analysis. It is a scientist's bread and butter. Today, we will be working primarily with the packages `dplyr` and `ggplot2` and to apply the skills you've learned so far to make some publication-ready plots - let's get started!

# To do

## Linear mdoels syntax

y ~ 1        y = B_0 
 
y ~ x        y = B_0 + B_1 x

y ~ x_1 + x_2    y = B_0 + B_1 x_1 + B_2 x_2

y ~ x + (1 | site)    y_j  = B_0_j + B_1 x_1

y ~ x + (1 | site) + (1 | year)    y_ij = B_0_j + B_0_i + B_1 x_1 + B_2 x_2

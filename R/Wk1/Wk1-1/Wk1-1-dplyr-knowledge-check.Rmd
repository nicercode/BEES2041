## Knowledge check: Take a look at the data {type=essay}

<h3>Knowledge check</h3>

**Question:** What do you notice that's different with how `mtcars` and `penguins` are presented in R? 

Write a few sentences on what is different in the object structure and what functions you used to determine the main difference between the two datasets.

## Knowledge check: Data manipulation with dplyr

**Try:** Use the function `filter()`to extract all penguins that have body masses greater than 4000g 

<div id="r-editor-135"><pre>
penguins
</pre>
</div>

**Question:** How many penguins were heavier than 4kg? `r cloze("172", c("101", "127", "172"))`

**Question:** What would the code look like if you wanted to sort the data by species, increasing bill length and decreasing body mass? 

```r
pengiuns |> 
  arrange(`r cloze("species", c(colnames(penguins)))`, `r cloze("bill_length_mm", c(colnames(penguins)))`, `r cloze("desc(body_mass_g)", c( "desc(bill_length_mm)", "desc(bill_depth_mm)","desc(body_mass_g)"))`)
```
**Question:** How many penguins were recorded on Dream Island? `r cloze("124", c("8", "124", "3250"))`

**Try**: Create a dataset where we only have the columns: species, island and integer variables

<div id="r-editor-136"><pre>
penguins
</pre>
</div>

**Try**: Can you give me the median bill_depth_mm for all species of penguins by sex? Watch out for missing values!

<div id="r-editor-137"><pre>
penguins
</pre>
</div>

**Try**: Using a series of pipes `|>`, create a dataset that: 

- only contains female penguins in 2007
- where their are body masses > 4000
- create a new ratio variable between bill depth and bill length
- retain only species, island and your ratio variable

<div id="r-editor-138"><pre>
penguins
</pre>
</div>

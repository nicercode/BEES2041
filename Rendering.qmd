# todo 
- cosnolidate docs and readme

- remove install.pacakges() lines from .qmd files, no longer needed for webr
- file week 1,2 - webr & solution tags
- H3 - find and replace `##` with `<h3>` and `</h3>` for moodle compatibility ?
- workflow to create student version of .qmd file without solutions, and check it runs

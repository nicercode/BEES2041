### Q1) Samples and populations

Understanding the relationship between populations and the samples used to estimate their properties is essential for understanding the logic of statistical tests. We will use data from a population of known properties and examine how well samples of that population can represent the population.

Import the data file 'Population.csv' into R.

While you can do this with the menus, it is best to have a line of code to do this so that you can repeat your work very quickly later on (e.g. if you make a mess of things).

To this create a chunk of code in your notebook (Insert \> R at the top right of your notebook file), copy the following line of code into your empty chunk.

```{r}
Population <- read.csv(file = "Population.csv", header = T)
```

You can execute the code with the little green arrow to the right of the chunk. In this case, `read.csv` is the function that imports a .csv file. The data has been assigned (the \<- symbol) to an object in R called Population. This object is a data frame and will now be visible in the Data window on the top right. There are other sorts of objects in R that we will learn as we go along, but we will use data frames throughout the course. These are just like spreadsheets where every column is a variable and every row is an observation.

The Sampling data frame consists of just one column named 'Size' with 200 individual measurements. Imagine these as the sizes of... *[insert your favourite animal, vegetable or mineral]*.

Visualise the size variation in your population by graphing the size variable using a frequency histogram and a box plot.

For graphing in this course, we are going to use the very flexible R package called [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Create a chunk right up the top of your notebook and insert this code that uses the library function to load the package. by running the following code:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

To get a frequency histogram, create another chunk of code and add:

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(Population, aes(Size)) + geom_histogram()
```

The syntax of ggplot is a bit weird to begin with but there are three essential elements:

1.  which object holds the data (in this case, Population)

2.  what variable(s) do you want to plot in the `aes()` function (in this case, Size)

3.  what sort of graph do you want, added after the + as a geom (in this case, a histogram)
